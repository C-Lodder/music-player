This is an alternative to iTunes.

The application will parse your iTunes XML library, displays all your playlists/songs, and allow you to play them.

## Usage

```bash
npm ci
```

2. Export your iTunes library and name the file `library.xml`

3. Place the XML file in the project's root directory

4. Run the application:
